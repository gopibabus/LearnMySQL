### ✳Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)

?> A Relational Database Management System refers to a database that stores data in a structured format, using rows and columns. This makes it easy to locate and access specific values within the database. It is "relational" because the values within each table are related to each other. Tables may also be related to other tables. The relational structure makes it possible to run queries across multiple tables at once.

?> RDBMS uses **SQL (Structured Query Language)**. SQL is used for manipulating and querying data in relational databases.

### ✳NoSQL(Not Only SQL)

?> **NoSQL**, which stands for “not only SQL,” is an approach to database design that provides flexible schemas for the storage and retrieval of data beyond the traditional table structures found in relational databases. The most common types of NoSQL databases are key-value, document, column and graph databases. NoSQL databases do not follow all the rules of a relational database
