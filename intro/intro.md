?> A **Database** is a collection of data stored in a format that can easily be accessed.

?> A **database management system (DBMS)** is system software for creating and managing databases. A DBMS makes it possible for end users to create, read, update and delete data in a database.

## ⚡Types of Database Management Systems(DBMS)?

<img alt="SQL vs NoSQL" width="700px" src="/assets/images/sql_nosql.png" />

> There are **4** types of DBMS.

1. Hierarchical DBMS
2. Network DBMS
3. Relational DBMS
4. Object Oriented DBMS

?> Each DBMS has it's own use cases. But most used and popular DBMS is **Relational DBMS**.

### ✳Hierarchical Database Management Systems (HDBMS)

?> A hierarchical database model is a data model in which the data are organized into a tree-like structure. The data are stored as records which are connected to one another through links. A record is a collection of fields, with each field containing only one value. The type of a record defines which fields the record contains.

?> The hierarchical database model mandates that each child record has only one parent, whereas each parent record can have one or more child records. In order to retrieve data from a hierarchical database the whole tree needs to be traversed starting from the root node. This model is recognized as the first database model created by IBM in the 1960s.

### ✳Network Database Management Systems (NDBMS)

?> The network model is a database model conceived as a flexible way of representing objects and their relationships. Its distinguishing feature is that the schema, viewed as a graph in which object types are nodes and relationship types are arcs, is not restricted to being a hierarchy or lattice. These are replaced by relational databases in the 1980s.

### ✳Object Oriented Database Management Systems (OODDBMS)

?> An object database is a database management system in which information is represented in the form of objects as used in object-oriented programming. Object databases are different from relational databases which are table-oriented. Object-relational databases are a hybrid of both approaches. Object databases have been considered since the early 1980s.

### ✳Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)

?> A Relational Database Management System refers to a database that stores data in a structured format, using rows and columns. This makes it easy to locate and access specific values within the database. It is "relational" because the values within each table are related to each other. Tables may also be related to other tables. The relational structure makes it possible to run queries across multiple tables at once.

?> RDBMS uses **SQL (Structured Query Language)**. SQL is used for manipulating and querying data in relational databases.

### ✳NoSQL(Not Only SQL)

?> **NoSQL**, which stands for “not only SQL,” is an approach to database design that provides flexible schemas for the storage and retrieval of data beyond the traditional table structures found in relational databases. The most common types of NoSQL databases are key-value, document, column and graph databases. NoSQL databases do not follow all the rules of a relational database
