## âš¡SELECT
### âœ³Retrieve entire data from customers table

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers;
```

### âœ³Retrieve specific column data from customers table

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customers;
```

### âœ³Use Mathematical Expressions in SQL queries

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, points, (points + 10) * 100 FROM customers;
```

### âœ³Use alias in SQL queries

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, points, (points + 10) * 100 AS discount_factor FROM customers;

SELECT first_name, last_name, points, (points + 10) * 100 AS 'discount factor' FROM customers;
```

### âœ³Retrieve unique set of state data from customers table

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT state FROM customers;
```

## âš¡WHERE

### âœ³Retrieve filtered data from customers table

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE points > 3000;

SELECT * FROM customers WHERE state = 'VA';

SELECT * FROM customers WHERE state != 'VA';
-- Alternative
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE state <> 'VA';

SELECT * FROM customers WHERE birth_date > '1990-01-01';
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date >= '2019-01-01';
```

## âš¡AND, OR and NOT
### âœ³Combining multiple filters

!> Please consider precedence of operators **(AND > OR)**

```sql

SELECT * 
FROM customers 
WHERE NOT (birth_date >= '1990-01-01' OR points > 1000);

SELECT * 
FROM order_items 
WHERE order_id = 6 AND (unit_price * quantity) > 30;
```

## âš¡IN
### âœ³Find match in the given arguments

SELECT * 
FROM customers 
ORDER BY state DESC, first_name DESC;
```

```sql
-- Get Customers sorted by first 2 columns [This is not a ideal way of sorting]
SELECT * 
FROM customers
