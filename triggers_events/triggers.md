CREATE TRIGGER payments_after_insert
	AFTER INSERT ON payments
    FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
	UPDATE invoices
    SET payment_total = payment_total + NEW.amount
    WHERE invoice_id = NEW.invoice_id;
END $$
DELIMITER ;

-- In order to check for our trigger

SELECT * FROM sql_invoicing.invoices;
INSERT INTO payments VALUES (DEFAULT, 5, 3, '2019-01-01', 10, 1);
```

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE TRIGGER payments_after_delete
	AFTER DELETE ON payments
    FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
	UPDATE invoices
    SET payment_total = payment_total - OLD.amount
    WHERE invoice_id = OLD.invoice_id;
