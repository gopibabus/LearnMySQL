### âœ³Functions

?> A **function/stored function** is a special kind stored program that returns a single value. Typically, you use stored functions to encapsulate common formulas or business rules that are reusable among SQL statements or stored programs.

?> Different from a stored procedure, you can use a stored function in SQL statements wherever an expression is used. This helps improve the readability and maintainability of the procedural code.

```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE FUNCTION get_risk_factor_for_client(client_id INT)
RETURNS INTEGER
READS SQL DATA
MODIFIES SQL DATA
BEGIN
	DECLARE risk_factor DECIMAL(9, 2) DEFAULT 0;
    DECLARE invoices_total DECIMAL(9, 2);
    DECLARE invoices_count INT;

    SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(invoice_total)
    INTO invoices_count, invoices_total
    FROM invoices i
    WHERE i.client_id = client_id;

    SET risk_factor = invoices_total / invoices_count * 5;
	RETURN IFNULL(risk_factor, 0);
END$$
DELIMITER ;

DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_risk_factor_for_client;

-- How to use functions

SELECT
	client_id,
    name,
    get_risk_factor_for_client(client_id) AS risk_factor
FROM clients;
```
